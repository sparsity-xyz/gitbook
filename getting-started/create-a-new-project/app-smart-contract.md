# App Smart Contract

## 1. App Smart Contract

A smart contract is essential for securely recording critical information, such as user data and on-chain configuration, when the application is initialized. This ensures transparency, trust, and verifiability for every interaction within the app.

**Implementing Your Smart Contract**

Developers must extend the Template contract, which serves as the foundational contract for Sparsity applications. The template contract can be found here: 👉 \[Template Contract]

**Required Functions**

To interact with Sparsity, developers must implement the following functions in the smart contract:

```solidity
interface APPInterface {
    // Called by the Outpost when a session is successfully created
    // sessionId: Unique session identifier
    // session: A struct containing endpoint, address, and session status
    function callbackSession(uint256 sessionId, CallbackSession memory session) external;

    // Called by the Outpost when a session ends
    // sessionId: Unique session identifier
    // isRevert: Indicates if the session was successful
    // data: Encoded final result from Sparsity Network
    function callbackSettlement(uint256 sessionId, bool isRevert, bytes memory data) external;
}
```

These callback functions must be exposed in the smart contract to enable communication with the Sparsity contract.

Simultaneously, the Sparsity Outpost contract exposes the following interface:

```solidity
interface OutpostInterface {
    // sessionId: Unique session identifier
    // initialData: Encoded initial data to pass to Sparsity Network
    function newSession(uint256 sessionId, bytes memory initialData) external;

    // address: User's wallet address to add to the session, allowing them to interact with Sparsity Network
    // sessionId: Unique session identifier
    function authIn(address account, uint256 sessionId) external;

    // address: User's wallet address to remove from the session
    // sessionId: Unique session identifier
    function authOut(address account, uint256 sessionId) external;
}
```

App developer can interact with these functions to manage sessions and authentication though the developer’s smart contract.

#### Key Concepts

🔹 **Session**\
A session represents the entire lifecycle of an app’s execution. It determines whether a user is within a session and helps manage authentication. The session ID must be unique for each session.\
&#xNAN;**`initialData`** is the encoded data that the user passes to the Sparsity network when initializing the session.

🔹 **Auth**\
Auth verifies whether an address has permission to use Sparsity within a session. This information is eventually relayed from the mainnet to the Sparsity network, where the App ABCI Core can utilize it.

🔹 **Settle**\
When Sparsity completes its computation, the results are returned via a callback and recorded in the developer’s smart contract.

By following this approach, developers can ensure that their application's critical state and user data are securely stored and seamlessly integrated within the Sparsity ecosystem.
