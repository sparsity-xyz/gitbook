# Quick Start

## **Getting Started with Sparsity**

Kickstart your journey with Sparsity by running a **"Hello World"** demo! This example walks you through **leveraging the Sparsity network for off-chain computation** using a simple Fibonacci app. In just 2**0 minutes**, you'll set up your development environment and gain hands-on experience with the **full development pipeline**.

### **What You’ll Learn**

This demo introduces the **end-to-end Sparsity App workflow**, including:

1️⃣ **Submitting a request** from a smart contract.\
2️⃣ **Executing the computation** using the Sparsity computing engine.\
3️⃣ **Retrieving the final result**, seamlessly settled back on-chain.
