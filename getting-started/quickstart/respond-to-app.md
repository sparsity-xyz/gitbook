# Respond to App

## 3. Settling the Result to the App

With the settlement value obtained in the previous section, the **Outpost Contract** will use this value as input and write it back to the user-developed smart contract.

The result of `fibonacci(22)` must also be **ABI-encoded**. Retrieve the computed data from the **App ABCI Core** section and run the validation test:

#### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Navigate to the Contract Directory

```sh
cd contract
```

#### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Settle the Result

Run the following command to settle the computed result into the original smart contract:

```sh
RESULT=0x000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000452f NUM=22 npx hardhat test test/app.ts --network localhost
```

Once executed, the result will be successfully recorded in the smart contract.
