# System Architecture

## **Understanding the Sparsity System**

Sparsity is built on two core components: the **Host Chain** and the **Sparsity Network**.

* The **Host Chain** serves as the primary blockchain where applications operate.
* The **Sparsity Network** manages ephemeral roll-ups for off-chain computation.

Currently, Sparsity supports most **EVM-compatible chains** (such as Base, Ethereum, and BNB Smart Chain) and will integrate non-EVM blockchains like **Solana** in the future.

This architecture connects three key participants:

* **App Users** ‚Äì Interact with decentralized applications.
* **App Developers/Owners** ‚Äì Build and deploy applications.
* **Computing Resource Providers** ‚Äì Offer computational power for roll-up execution.

### **Integrating an App with Sparsity** (For Developers)

To integrate an application with Sparsity, the app developer/owner must:

1Ô∏è‚É£ **Deploy the App Smart Contract** ‚Äì The smart contract must be deployed on the host chain.\
2Ô∏è‚É£ **Register the Smart Contract & ABCI Core** ‚Äì Register the app‚Äôs smart contract and **public Docker-based ABCI core** with the Sparsity contract on the host chain.\
3Ô∏è‚É£ **Publish the App Client (Optional)** ‚Äì If the app requires a user-facing interface, the developer may choose to publish an app client.\
4Ô∏è‚É£ **Bridge Between Host Chain & Sparsity Network (Optional)** ‚Äì Sparsity provides a built-in bridge, eliminating the need for custom implementations.

### **Computing Resource Providers Workflow**

1Ô∏è‚É£ **Register Resources** ‚Äì Computing providers register their **IP/domain/URL** with the Sparsity Network.

### **How an App User Interacts with the App**

1Ô∏è‚É£ **User Interaction** ‚Äì The user interacts with the app‚Äôs smart contract on the host chain.\
2Ô∏è‚É£ **Triggering Sparsity Contract** ‚Äì The smart contract invokes the **Sparsity contract** on the host chain.\
3Ô∏è‚É£ **Resource Allocation** ‚Äì The **Sparsity bridge** assigns computing resources and deploys the ephemeral roll-up within the Sparsity Network.\
4Ô∏è‚É£ **Writing Back to Host Chain** ‚Äì The **Sparsity bridge** writes roll-up machine details back to the app‚Äôs smart contract on the host chain.\
5Ô∏è‚É£ **Roll-Up Interaction** ‚Äì The user interacts with the ephemeral roll-up via the app client and smart contract.\
6Ô∏è‚É£ **Final Settlement** ‚Äì Intermediate states and final computation results are written back to the host chain through the **Sparsity bridge**.

With Sparsity, developers can **effortlessly scale** their dApps, leveraging **decentralized infrastructure and high-performance computation** to create the next generation of Web3 applications! üöÄ
